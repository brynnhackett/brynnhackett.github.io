<h3> There is a <b>place</b> </h3>
<p> where the sidewalk <s>ends</s> 

<br />And before the street begins,
<br />And there the grass <b>grows</b> <i>soft and white</i>,
<ol>
<br />And there the sun burns crimson bright,
<br />And there the moon-bird rests from his <sup>flight</sup>
<br />To cool in the peppermint wind.</p>
<ol>
<h4> Let us leave this place </h4> 

<p>where the smoke blows black
<br />And the dark street <i>winds</i> and <i>bends</i>.
<br />Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow </p>

<ol>
<p> We shall walk with a walk that is <sub>measured and slow,</sub>
<br /> And watch where the chalk-white arrows go
<br /> To the place where the <s>sidewalk ends</s>.</p>

<ol>
<h5>Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,</h5>
<p>And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
<br />For the children, they mark, and the children, they know</p>

<ol>
<p style="margin-left: 120px">The place where</p>
